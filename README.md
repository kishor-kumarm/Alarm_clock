I'm Kishor, this Project the all about making an Alarm clock using vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks are allowed for Javascript.

Basic functionality has been created as per the given problem statement

1. Display the Digital Clock which suppose to show a real-time clock containing Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Sessions/periods (AM/PM)
2. Created a form to take the time input (HH:MM:SS AM/PM) from the Client with and Set Alarm button to add the alarm to the Alarm List. Once any Alarm is triggered then an alert has been shown to the user.
3. Alarm List has been created which updated the current UI as well as saved to local storage so once we revisit the alarm page our alarm will be saved and will be displayed in the UI.
4. For each Alarm there has been Deleted button once we delete any particular alarm it will delete the alarm from the local storage as well as update the UI with the updated list.

As per the design document code comments, indentation, structure, function, and variable name fulfilling the requirements.
